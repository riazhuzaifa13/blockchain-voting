(Q) Why can i see who voted for whom?

(A) In our system, the Admin can see that a vote was cast,
 but they cannot see who cast it because the CNIC is mathematically hashed.
 This prevents the Admin from targeting or punishing voters based on their choices,
 ensuring a fair and private election.
